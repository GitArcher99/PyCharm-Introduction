# PyCharm-Introduction
PyCharm makes coding easier by using colors to highlight different parts of the code, like variables and keywords, which makes it easier to read and fix mistakes. Also suggests code as you type, which saves time and helps avoid errors. Lastly, it shows mistakes right away, so you can fix them before running the program.
